A Simple guide how to go about these Folders:

1) Open "Yolo_phone_detection_Model" Folder
    -> It has the full annotated Dataset
    -> It has the Code to Train the model and check images and live video in "qwe.py" inside "Code" Folder
    -> It has the generated "Best.pt" file also.

2) now Open "flask_Website" folder
     -> run the "app.py" and now the full app is deployed into your local system
